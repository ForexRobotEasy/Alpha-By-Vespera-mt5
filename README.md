# Alpha By Vespera MT5

## Description
This code is for the Alpha By Vespera MT5 forex robot, developed by the Forex Robot Easy Team. The robot is designed to optimize USD/CAD trades in 15 minutes. This code includes the necessary functions and parameters to implement the trading strategy of the robot.

This code utilizes the Keltner channel indicator to determine entry and exit points for trades. The Keltner channel is calculated using a moving average and the average true range. The upper and lower channels are then used to determine whether to buy or sell.

## Usage
To use this code, you will need to have the MetaTrader 5 platform installed and an account with a compatible broker. Once you have the platform set up, you can copy and paste this code into the MetaEditor and compile it into an expert advisor (EA). You can then attach the EA to a chart and configure the input parameters.

The input parameters for this EA include:
- KeltnerPeriod: the period used to calculate the Keltner channel
- KeltnerDeviation: the deviation multiplier for the Keltner channel
- StopLoss: the stop loss level for trades
- TakeProfit: the take profit level for trades
